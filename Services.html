The popular belief is that resumes land jobs. NOT TRUE. The resume's sole purpose is to land
you an interview. A resume is to give your potential employer a feel for your past experience and
skills. Remember you are trying to sell yourself, so emphasize your strengths. Most employers
look for a steady job history and positive patterns of progression (i.e. increased responsibility,
promotions). However, each organization has different demands and it is essential to learn as
much as possible about the employer and what he or she is looking for. Your resume should be
tailored as much as possible to match each employer’s needs.
Employers not only use resumes to find a good fit, they also use them to weed through the
applicants. At this point in the hiring process employers are handling numerous resumes and they
are looking for mistakes to narrow the applicant pool. From the resume, the employer will decide
who they will and will not interview.
Remember your resume should be a reflection of you! Although, certain standard elements are
included in all resumes, there is no perfect resume mold that you must ascribe to. Your resume
should accurately reflect your background and experience in a way that optimizes your
qualifications. One way to maximize the impact of your resume is to choose a style that will
make your personal history as attractive as possible.
If your resume is well-written, it will generate phone calls asking you to come in for interviews.
If you are not getting phone calls and you are sending out resumes, then you need to take a closer
look at what you are sending out. Any resume can list employment dates and job position titles,
but only the best ones speak the language employers want to hear.

<h1>Three Types of Resumes: </h1>

<h1>1. Chronological: </h1> The most commonly used style, with the sections of your resume being
listed in reverse chronological order. In this standard type of resume work experience is
listed along with relevant job duties, which makes up the bulk of the resume. This is the
most popular type of resume for people with less than 3-5 years of experience.

<h1> 2. Functional:</h1> This format might be helpful if you desire a career change but do not have
much related experience, if your employment history is unstable, or if you don’t have any
professional experience. Instead of focusing on your work history this type of resume
focuses on the different skills that you have acquired along the way.

<h1> 3. Combination:</h1> As the title indicates this type of resume is a combination of the
chronological and functional resume. This may be used when there is more than 5 years
of work experience.

<h1> DO NOT USE A TEMPLATE</h1>, it can be difficult to work with and can be viewed as
unoriginal. Make sure you are consistent throughout the resume with spacing, punctuation, use of
bold and caps, bullets or no bullets, and date style. Use an easy to read and appropriate font.
Generally people have 4-9 headings on their resume; there may be some headings that do not
apply to you or the job. -->
